# Q&A with PDF  document(s)! 

This is an experimental project showcasing semantic search on proprietary knowledgebase (custom PDF documents) by using a combination of embedding technique and pre-trained LLM. Embedding is a process of converting text into a vector representation that captures the meaning of the text. LLM is a large language model that can be used to understand the meaning of text.

* Use **Settings** (right most icon on textbox below) to set your choice of embedding model and vector store.

* Use **UP** (second from right on textbox below) to pick cached request.

**Note** - `This portal assumes that all vector stores for all permutation of embedding/vector_store are created upfront and available.`
