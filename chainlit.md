# Q&A with PDF  document(s)! 

This is an experimental project showcasing semantic search for PDF documents by using combination of **Document Embedding Search** and **LLM** Embedding is a process of converting text into a vector representation that captures the meaning of the text. LLM is a large language model that can be used to understand the meaning of text.

* Use **Settings** (right most icon on textbox below) to set your choice of embedding model and vector store.

* Use **UP** (second from right on textbox below) to pick cached request.

**Note** - `This portal assumes that all vector stores for all permutation of embedding/vector_store are created upfront and available.`
